    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lemon pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>Â½ cup whipping cream</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons capers, drained and rinsed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

        <h3>Step1</h3>
        <p>
          Season chicken breasts with lemon pepper, salt, dill weed, and garlic
          powder.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step2</h3>
        <p>
          Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place breasts in
          skillet, and increase heat to medium-high. Turn chicken frequently,
          until brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, and cook 5 to 7
          minutes, until breasts are cooked through. Remove chicken to a warm
          serving platter, and cover with foil.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step3</h3>
        <p>
          Return skillet to stove, and increase heat to high. Whisk in whipping
          cream, whisking continuously until reduced to sauce consistency, about
          3 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in capers. Pour sauce over chicken,
          and serve.
